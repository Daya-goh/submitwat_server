## Project Overview
The inspiration for this project came from my personal experience as a teacher. Teachers have heavy workload and a lot of admin to do. One of the important but also time consuming task we do frequently is tracking students' submission of various things. I often wished to have a personal homework management app that can help to streamline this process and also help to keep track of the homework given out and collected. 

This is a homework management app to help teachers streamline the process of collecting, tracking and managing homeworks given to classes. Teachers can easily log the submission status of students' homework easily, have an overivew of the students submission, a notes tracker to help them keep the notes during marking.

## Core functions of app
This homework tracker's main function is to allow teacher to update the homework submission status within 1 minute and it will give teacher an overview of the status clearly at the same time. 
Hence, there is a function in the application where after teacher updates the status of students who did not submit their hoemwork, can update the rest of the class' status easily with one click.

The overview submission status page is color-coded accordingly to help teachers identify the students that have yet to submit their homework and need reminders and "chasing" after.

## Key Learning and AFI
I would wish to update the backend of the project from static SQL to dynamic SQL. This will allow the application to have more functionality like selecting the homework to display on the application.
